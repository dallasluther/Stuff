"crucial.bashrc" is the most important parts of my Linux .bashrc script, since it allows me to find commands instantly and to know if a command gave a hidden error or not. Just copy-paste the content into your .bashrc file (tested on Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian and Arch) if you want the same feature. The screenshot of my KDE desktop shows an example in the top-right window where you can see it highlights my commands in green unless if it had an error in which case it highlights the next command as red.
